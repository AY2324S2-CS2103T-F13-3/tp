## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a courseMate).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact data i.e., all `CourseMate` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCourseMateList` object).
* stores the group data i.e., all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `CourseMate` or `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<CourseMate>` or `ObservableList<Group>` objects that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### [UI] Coursemate Detail Panel

#### Implementation

The courseMate detail panel in the UI shows the details of a selected or recently processed courseMate. It is implemented in the `CourseMateDetailPanel` class.

The `CourseMateDetailPanel` class is mutable, the displayed courseMate can be change by calling the `CourseMateDetailPanel#loadCourseMate(CourseMate)` method.

The following shows the sequence diagrams of how the UI component loads the courseMates into the courseMate detail panel dynamically.

1. The user selects a courseMate from the courseMate list panel.

   <puml src="diagrams/CourseMateListSelectSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CourseMateListSelectSequenceDiagram" />

   The main window implements the functional interface `CourseMateDetailPanel#CourseMateSelectHandler` to reflect the selected courseMate in the courseMate detail panel and the `Logic`, which saves the selected courseMate in the `Model` used for future commands with the `##` notation.

2. The user executes a command that modifies the selected courseMate.

    <puml src="diagrams/ProcessedCourseMateSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ProcessedCourseMateSequenceDiagram" />

    The `CommandResult` object returned by the `Logic` component contains a flag that indicates if the command involves one processed courseMate. If so, `CourseMateDetailPanel` is updated with the processed courseMate.

Two types of selection in the courseMate list panel are supported: double click and pressing the enter key. This requires two different event handlers to be implemented in the `CourseMateListPanel` class as shown below. These event handlers are instantiated and set as the event handlers for the `ListView` object in the constructor of `CourseMateListPanel`.

<puml src="diagrams/CourseMateListPanelClassDiagram.puml" alt="CourseMateListPanelClassDiagram" />


#### Alternatives Considered

* **Alternative 1:** The courseMate detail panel is immutable, and a new panel is created for each courseMate.
  * Pros: Easier to implement since the other UI components no longer have to keep a reference to the courseMate detail panel.
  * Cons: It makes it unclear that `MainWindow` and `CourseMateDetailPanel` have a one-to-one whole-part relationship.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow the courseMate list panel to directly update the courseMate detail panel.
  * Pros: Simplifies the code as the `MainWindow` no longer has to act as a middleman. The functional interface `CourseMateDetailPanel#CourseMateSelectHandler` can be removed.
  * Cons: The `CourseMateListPanel` and `CourseMateDetailPanel` are more tightly coupled. This increases maintenance costs.

* **Alternative 3:** Give full control to the `Logic` component to update the courseMate detail panel.
  * Pros: We no longer need to include an extra field in the `CommandResult` object to indicate if the command involves one processed courseMate.
  * Cons: The `Logic` component is now responsible for updating the UI, which is not ideal as the `Logic` component should not be aware of the UI's click and press events.

### [Model & Storage] Groups

#### Implementation

A `Group` is a list of unique courseMates with a few extra metadata. Thus, it makes sense for it to inherit from `UniqueCourseMateList`.

A `Group` is given a unique case-sensitive name when constructed. It may also be given a set of unique `Skill` objects, unique member `CourseMate` objects, and an optional `TelegramChat` object.

`CourseMate` objects are kept unique by ensuring no two `CourseMate` objects have the same name, using the `CourseMate::isSameCourseMate` method. `Skill` and `Name` objects are kept unique using their respective `equals` methods.

A `GroupList` is also used to maintain the list of all unique groups created. The model manager maintains a single copy of this `GroupList`.

The `GroupList` object maintains a single copy of a `UniqueGroupList`, this class enforces uniqueness using `Group::isSameGroup` and also maintains an observable copy of the list for the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/GroupClassDiagram.puml" alt="GroupClassDiagram" />

### Alternatives Considered

* **Alternative 1:** `GroupList` is a singleton class.
  * Pros: It makes sense that we only have a single `GroupList` at any one time in normal usage.
  * Cons: As with most singletons, it does make testing more difficult as different tests will have a harder time using different lists of groups.
* **Alternative 2:** `Group` does not inherit `UniqueCourseMateList`.
  * Pros: It isn't exactly clear-cut that `Group` *is a* `UniqueCourseMateList`, since `UniqueCourseMateList` is also used to display info to the UI through the observer pattern, causing potential for unneeded coupling.
  * Cons: It does make enough sense that a `Group` has *most* properties of a `UniqueCourseMateList`, using another class may also result in code duplication.
* **Alternative 3:** `Group` objects are given an ID instead of being kept unique through their names.
  * Pros: It allows for multiple `Group` objects to have the same name, and an ID makes more sense conceptually to differentiate objects than a `Name`.
  * Cons: It is not clear that multiple `Group` objects should be allowed to have the same name, it may also be harder to uniquely refer to groups in the app if you have to use an ID to differentiate.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Environment**: Should work on any _mainstream_ OS as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. **Performance**: Should respond to user interaction within 3 seconds at most for typical usage (unless it is lagging due to reasons external to the app).
3. **Performance**: Should be able to hold up to 1000 _courseMates_ without a noticeable sluggishness in performance (as specified above) for typical usage.
4. **Resilience**: Should gracefully handle commonly anticipated errors (e.g. incorrect _command_ input) without crashing or losing saved data.
5. **Accessibility**: Should notify the user whether a _command_ is successful or has failed.
6. **Accessibility**: Should be accessible to English speakers with average typing speed.
7. **Accessibility**: Usage of basic _commands_ (e.g. add, edit) should be learnable within a day.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Command**: A user input that will cause the application to perform an operation according to the MatchMate UserGuide
* **Coursemate**: A friend or classmate that you expect to form a _group_ based on certain _skills_ they might have
* **Group**: A grouping/team of _courseMates_ for a course, project, or activity
* **Skill**: Knowledge, ability, or experience that a _courseMate_ has 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Creating an edit group command**: Currently, the user can only edit the group name of a project group by deleting the group and re-creating it. All information in the group will be cleared after that. We plan to implement an edit group command that allows the user to edit the group name without losing the information in the group, by supplying the original group name and the new group name.

2. **Improved filtering when adding or removing members in a group with similar names**: When trying to add or remove a member from a group using a substring of the member's name, the app currently lists all courseMates with the substring in their name, regardless of whether they are already in the group. This causes the user having to re-try the command using the hashtag notation unnecessarily. We plan to enhance this filtering by excluding members that are already in the group for the `add-member` command, and excluding members that are not in the group for the `remove-member` command.

3. **Provide warnings for `require-skill` and `unrequire-skill` when skill is already required / unrequired**: Currently, the app does not provide any feedback when a user tries to require a skill that is already required, or unrequire a skill that is already unrequired. We plan to provide a warning message in such cases to inform the user that the command has no effect, and suggest the user to check for typos.

4. **Provide warnings for `mark-important` and `unmark-important` when skill is already marked / unmarked as important**: Currently, the app does not provide any feedback when a user tries to mark a skill as important that is already marked as important, or unmark a skill that is already unmarked. We plan to provide a warning message in such cases to inform the user that the command has no effect, and suggest the user to check for typos.

5. **Provide warnings for `add-skill` and `delete-skill` when skill is already added / deleted**: Currently, the app does not provide any feedback when a user tries to add a skill that is already added, or delete a skill that is already deleted. We plan to provide a warning message in such cases to inform the user that the command has no effect, and suggest the user to check for typos.

6. **Allow case-insensitive command names**: Currently, the app only recognizes command names in lowercase. We plan to allow users to enter the command names in any case (e.g. `Add`, `aDd`, `ADD`), and the app will recognize them as the same command.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.
